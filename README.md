A web-based survey designed to collect information from students regarding their home demographics and their impressions of the Business Analytics major. This survey aims to gather valuable insights for academic department improvements and student engagement strategies.

## Best Practices

For the basic idea of best practices for forms. I Included required fields, dropdown text boxes, tooltips, and single answer from options, and check marks from options. One thing important to forms, it to make it so it the user can put minimum effort in it and it guides them through it. With this, I made it easy for the them to go onto the next page. I made the survey very simple and easy to read.

### Accessibility

In creating this survey, I took into consideration to make it accessible and respectful to everyone. In regards to race/gender questions, I allowed options for all of the races and for genders, I provided the list given to me from the Unviersity of Iowa survey. I also gave the option for decline to answer in respect for everyone. In regards to people that are colorblind, I did some designing to make it accessible for them. I provided red asterisks to show that it is a required field.
